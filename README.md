kate
====

kate is an extraction of the paypal SDK vendor code, normally
found in a file called: paypal_platform_ruby_sdk.zip

It has been reformatted, and slightly modified to be useful to me.

name
====

Why the name?  She is married to Prince William.
Why Prince William?  He's your PrinciPal, which is like your Paypal.

(Okay, it's a stupid reason to use a nice four letter name,
suggest something better)
